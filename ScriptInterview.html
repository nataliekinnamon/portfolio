    <br>I'm designing my senior collection. <br>

  <div class="box03">
    <br>And what is a senior collection? <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box04">
    <br>We have to design 5 looks. The first semester is designing the patterns. <br>
    <img src="IMG_9385.jpg" width="100%">
  </div>

  <div class="box05">
    <br>The second is using the patterns to create our looks out of muslin or practice fabric. <br>
    <img src="IMG_9373.jpg" width="100%">
  </div>

  <div class="box06">
    <br> The third is spent putting together our looks with our actual fabric. <br>
    <img src="IMG_9387.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
  </div>

  <div class="box07">
    <br> WOW THAT LOOKS AWESOME! <br>
    <br> And what is your concept for your collection? <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box08">
    <br>I’m designing clothes specifically for people with Type 1 diabetes. I’m calling it Type One of a Kind! <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box09">
    <br>And how did you come up with this concept? <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box10">

    <br>Well, I have Type 1 diabetes and I have a lot of trouble wearing clothes I want to wear because there is nowhere to put my insulin pump. For example, I can't wear body cons or slip dresses because there isn’t anywhere to put it, or it's
    bulging and ruins my look. <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box11">
    <br>Wow, that must be really frustrating! <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box12">
    <br>Yeah it is! <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box13">
    <br>So what are you doing differently than other clothing brands do? What designs make your clothes specific for people with T1D? <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box14">
    <br>My collection includes clothes that can accommodate insulin pumps and injection sites. I design my clothes with more pockets, hidden pockets, or other aspects like ruffles that can hide the bulge of an insulin pump. I’m also incorporating
  cut outs in places where people might use injections like in the arms or stomach. I want people to be able to wear what they want and feel amazing without sacrificing what they want to wear because they have diabetes. <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box15">
    <br> Wow, that's amazing! So can people without diabetes wear these clothes? <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box16">
    <br>Of course! Anyone can wear these clothes, I’m just also accommodating people with diabetes. <br>
  </div>

  <div class="box17">
    <br>That's great! <br>
  </div>
